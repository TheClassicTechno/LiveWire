## Modified Files

### Backend Code
📝 **`backend/live_component_api.py`**
- Lines 242, 268: Enhanced logging
- Shows model being called with exact details
- Proves to judges that model is being invoked

## Reading Order

1. **`DEMO_README.md`** (5 min) - Get oriented
2. **`DEMO_CHECKLIST.md`** (5 min) - Know the setup
3. **`JUDGE_DEMO_PROOF_OF_MODEL.md`** (10 min) - Learn full walkthrough
4. **`MODEL_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`** (5 min) - Understand technical details

Total time: 25 minutes to be fully prepared.

## Quick Lookup

| Question | File |
|----------|------|
| Where do I start? | DEMO_README.md |
| How do I set up? | DEMO_CHECKLIST.md |
| What if judges ask X? | JUDGE_DEMO_PROOF_OF_MODEL.md (FAQ) |
| How is the model integrated? | MODEL_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md |
| I'm nervous, what's my pitch? | JUDGE_DEMO_PROOF_OF_MODEL.md (Talking Points) |

## Before Demo (Do This)

- [ ] Read DEMO_README.md
- [ ] Read DEMO_CHECKLIST.md
- [ ] Run setup once to verify everything works
- [ ] Have all 3 terminals ready
- [ ] Know your 30-second pitch

## During Demo (Remember This)

- Point to backend console when model is called
- Highlight the "🤖 Calling RUL Gradient Boosting model..." line
- Show RUL countdown updating in frontend
- Demonstrate temperature spike → RUL drop
- Emphasize NASA C-MAPSS training data

## Success Indicators

✅ Backend logs show: "🤖 Calling RUL Gradient Boosting model..."
✅ Frontend RUL updates every 2 seconds
✅ Temperature spike scenario shows RUL dropping
✅ Judges understand that model is being called in real-time
