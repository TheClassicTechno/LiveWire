# Judge Demo Checklist - Live RUL Predictive Model

## 30 Minutes Before Demo

- [ ] Close all unnecessary applications
- [ ] Clear desktop/screen
- [ ] Test WiFi/internet connectivity

## Setup (Do This First)

### Terminal 1: Backend
```bash
cd /Users/Vanya/dev/LiveWire
python web_dashboard.py
```
**Wait for:**
```
âœ… RUL model artifacts loaded successfully
ðŸ”§ Initializing Live Component System
âœ… Initial RUL calculated: XXXh (green)
```

### Terminal 2: Frontend
```bash
cd /Users/Vanya/dev/LiveWire/frontend
npm start
```
**Wait for:**
```
webpack compiled successfully
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 in browser

### Terminal 3: Demo Ready
```bash
cd /Users/Vanya/dev/LiveWire
# DON'T RUN YET - Wait until judges arrive and ask to see the model working
```

---

## Judges Arrive: What to Show

### Act 1: Show Model is Loaded (1 min)
**Point to Terminal 1 output:**
```
âœ… RUL model artifacts loaded successfully
```
**Say:** "The system loaded the Gradient Boosting model trained on NASA turbofan failure data."

### Act 2: Run Live Demo (3 min)
**Run in Terminal 3:**
```bash
python demo_live_rul_with_model.py
```

**Watch for these console lines (Terminal 1):**
```
ðŸ¤– Calling RUL Gradient Boosting model (100 estimators, NASA C-MAPSS trained) with 68 engineered features...
âœ… Model prediction: XXXh RUL (ZONE) - Confidence: X.XXX
```

**Point and Say:** "There's the model prediction! 68 features, Gradient Boosting, 100 trees, making a real-time prediction."

### Act 3: Show Frontend (1 min)
**Browser (already open):**
1. Navigate to San Francisco map
2. Click the green sensor dot
3. **Point to RUL countdown panel**
4. **Say:** "This RUL is updating every 2 seconds with fresh model predictions from the backend."

### Act 4: Show Sensitivity (1 min)
**Demo output (Scenario 2):**
```
Scenario 2: Temperature Spike
  Baseline RUL: 152.1h
  T=25Â°C â†’ RUL: 152.1h
  T=35Â°C â†’ RUL: 148.3h (â†“ 3.8h)
  T=45Â°C â†’ RUL: 141.2h (â†“ 7.1h)
```

**Say:** "Watch what happens when temperature increases. RUL drops. That's real physics learned by the modelâ€”higher temperature means faster degradation."

## Console Output to Highlight

When demo runs, judges should see:

```
ðŸ“¡ Sent to Elasticsearch: T=25.0Â°C, V=0.1g, S=100Î¼
ðŸ”§ Engineering features from 21 sensor readings...
ðŸ“Š Scaling 68 features using trained scaler...
ðŸ¤– Calling RUL Gradient Boosting model (100 estimators, NASA C-MAPSS trained) with 68 engineered features...
ðŸ“ˆ Calculating model confidence from 100 RF trees...
âœ… Model prediction: 152.1h RUL (GREEN) - Confidence: 0.142
```

**Point out:**
- "Sensor data from Elasticsearch" âœ“
- "68 engineered features" âœ“
- "Gradient Boosting model called" âœ“
- "Actual RUL prediction: 152.1h" âœ“
- "Confidence score: 0.142" âœ“

## Talking Points

### If asked "How do we know the model is actually being used?"
> "Watch the backend console. Every 2 seconds it logs:
> - The sensor data fetched from Elasticsearch
> - The 68 features being engineered
> - The model being called
> - The RUL prediction being made
>
> If it was fake data, we couldn't change the prediction by changing sensor values. Watch the temperature spike scenarioâ€”RUL drops in real time."

### If asked "What's the model trained on?"
> "NASA C-MAPSS: Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation. Real turbofan engine data from engines that failed in operation. The model learned to recognize degradation patterns that predict failure."

### If asked "Is 100ms fast enough?"
> "Yes. Real-time monitoring means alerting humans within seconds. For operators to react, <1 second is fast enough. For automatic protective relays, we'd need <10ms, but for human-in-the-loop decisions, this is plenty fast."

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Backend says "Model not loaded"
```bash
ls -la models/artifacts/
# Should show: rul_model.pkl, rul_scaler.pkl, rul_feature_names.pkl
```

### Demo script fails
```bash
echo $ELASTIC_ENDPOINT
echo $ELASTIC_API_KEY
# Both should have values, if not:
export ELASTIC_ENDPOINT="https://my-elasticsearch-project-c80e6e.es.us-west1.gcp.elastic.cloud"
export ELASTIC_API_KEY="a3VJc0lKb0JkWTdGdTJC..."
```

### RUL not changing
1. Check backend is running
2. Check frontend is polling (F12 â†’ Network â†’ watch for /api/live-component/status)
3. Refresh frontend: Cmd+Shift+R

### Demo script too slow
- Network latency to Elasticsearch
- That's okay, it's still working
- Just slower than local testing

## Time Allocations

| Activity | Time | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Setup (all 3 terminals) | 5 min | Do before judges arrive |
| Show model loaded | 1 min | Terminal 1 output |
| Run demo script | 3 min | Watch backend logs |
| Show frontend | 1 min | Click sensor, show RUL |
| Explain sensitivity | 1 min | Temperature spike scenario |
| **Total** | **7-10 min** | Fits in most presentation slots |

## Success Criteria

Your demo is successful if judges see:

- âœ… Backend logs showing model being called
- âœ… RUL prediction values in logs
- âœ… Frontend displaying RUL countdown
- âœ… RUL changing when sensor values change
- âœ… Risk zone color changing (green â†’ yellow â†’ red)
- âœ… Console output proving the model is integrated

---

## Notes

- **Don't stress about latency** - Elasticsearch calls can be slow, that's normal
- **Don't use technical jargon unless judges ask** - Explain in simple terms
- **Do highlight the console output** - That's the proof they want to see
- **Do show the actual code briefly** if judges ask "how is it integrated"
  - Show `backend/live_component_api.py` line 242: "ðŸ¤– Calling RUL model"
  - Show `frontend/SensorDetailsPanel.js` line 168: polling the API
- **Do mention NASA C-MAPSS** - Shows credibility and real training data

## One More Time: The Core Message

**"We have a trained Gradient Boosting model that makes RUL predictions in real-time. Watch the backend consoleâ€”you'll see the model being called every time the frontend polls for an update. The model processes 68 engineered features and returns a prediction. The frontend displays this prediction as a countdown. When you change sensor values, the prediction changes. That proves the model is actually working."**

**You've got this! ðŸš€**
