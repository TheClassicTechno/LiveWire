### Sensitivity Testing (from diagnosis)
- [x] Early lifecycle: +50% stress = 0% RUL change
- [x] Mid lifecycle: +50% stress = 0% RUL change
- [x] Late lifecycle: +50% stress = +0.12% RUL change
- [x] Confirms time-based prediction dominance

### RUL Value Progression
- [x] Starts high (8400 cycles) at day 1
- [x] Decreases linearly over 35 days
- [x] Ends low (20 cycles) at day 35
- [x] Risk zones transition: green → yellow → red
- [x] Matches synthetic degradation curve

### Risk Zone Assignment
- [x] Green zone: RUL > 72h
- [x] Yellow zone: RUL 24-72h
- [x] Red zone: RUL < 24h
- [x] Color coding matches risk level
- [x] Risk score calculation correct
