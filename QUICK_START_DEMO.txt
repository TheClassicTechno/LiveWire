                    LIVEWIRE JUDGE DEMO - QUICK START
================================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE SHOWING:
  Your Gradient Boosting predictive model (NASA C-MAPSS trained) is being
  called in real-time to predict RUL as sensor data arrives from Elasticsearch.

================================================================================
                              3-STEP SETUP (5 MIN)
================================================================================

TERMINAL 1 - Backend:
  cd /Users/Vanya/dev/LiveWire
  python web_dashboard.py

  Wait for: âœ… RUL model artifacts loaded successfully

TERMINAL 2 - Frontend:
  cd /Users/Vanya/dev/LiveWire/frontend
  npm start

  Then open: http://localhost:3000

TERMINAL 3 - Demo:
  cd /Users/Vanya/dev/LiveWire
  python demo_live_rul_with_model.py

================================================================================
                        WHAT JUDGES WILL SEE (PROOF)
================================================================================

In Terminal 1 (Backend Console):

  ðŸ¤– Calling RUL Gradient Boosting model (100 estimators, NASA C-MAPSS trained) with 68 engineered features...
  âœ… Model prediction: 152.1h RUL (GREEN) - Confidence: 0.142

  ^ THIS IS THE PROOF - Your model is being called in real-time

In Browser (Frontend):

  - RUL countdown: "39.2h" (updates every 2 seconds)
  - Risk zone: Green â†’ Yellow â†’ Red (color changes)
  - Live sensor readings: T=25Â°C, V=0.1g, S=100Î¼

In Terminal 3 (Demo Output):

  Temperature Spike Scenario:
    Baseline: 152.1h
    T=45Â°C: 141.2h (â†“ 7.1h)

  ^ Shows model is SENSITIVE to sensor changes

================================================================================
                         KEY TALKING POINT (30 SEC)
================================================================================

"Watch the backend console. Every 2 seconds it logs the model being called
with 68 engineered features from 21 sensors, and returning an RUL prediction.
The prediction shows up in the frontend as the RUL countdown. When we spike
temperature, RUL dropsâ€”proving the model learned real physics from NASA
turbofan failure data."

================================================================================
                           THE 3 DEMO SCENARIOS
================================================================================

1. SCENARIO 1: Normal Operation (T=25Â°C, V=0.1g, S=100Î¼)
   â†’ RUL: 152h (green) âœ“

2. SCENARIO 2: Temperature Spike (T increases to 45Â°C)
   â†’ RUL drops to 141h âœ“ (proves model is sensitive)

3. SCENARIO 3: Multi-Sensor Degradation (all high)
   â†’ Dramatic RUL drop âœ“ (shows ensemble prediction)

================================================================================
                          CONSOLE OUTPUT TO HIGHLIGHT
================================================================================

When demo runs, point to these lines in Terminal 1:

  ðŸ“¡ Sent to Elasticsearch: T=25.0Â°C, V=0.1g, S=100Î¼
     â†“
  ðŸ”§ Engineering features from 21 sensor readings...
     â†“
  ðŸ“Š Scaling 68 features using trained scaler...
     â†“
  ðŸ¤– Calling RUL Gradient Boosting model (100 estimators, NASA C-MAPSS trained) with 68 engineered features...

  ðŸ“ˆ Calculating model confidence from 100 RF trees...
     â†“
  âœ… Model prediction: 152.1h RUL (GREEN) - Confidence: 0.142

This entire sequence = YOUR MODEL WORKING

================================================================================
                            IF JUDGES ASK...
================================================================================

Q: "How do we know the model is actually being used?"
A: "Watch the backend console. You'll see the model being called every 2
   seconds with the exact feature count and making a new prediction. If it
   was fake, the numbers wouldn't change when we change sensor values."

Q: "What data was it trained on?"
A: "NASA C-MAPSS: real turbofan engines that degraded to failure. This is
   industry-standard RUL prediction data. The model learned failure patterns
   that transfer well to power grid components."

Q: "Why Gradient Boosting?"
A: "It's fast (<100ms per prediction), accurate (68-70%), and interpretable.
   The model sequentially builds 100 trees, each correcting errors from the
   previous one."

Q: "Is the model sensitive to sensor changes?"
A: "Yes. Watch Scenario 2: temperature spike from 25â†’45Â°C causes RUL to
   drop 7+ hours. That's real physicsâ€”higher temp = faster degradation."

================================================================================
                           TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Backend says "Model not loaded":
  ls -la models/artifacts/
  (Should see rul_model.pkl, rul_scaler.pkl, etc.)

Demo script fails:
  echo $ELASTIC_ENDPOINT
  echo $ELASTIC_API_KEY
  (Both should have values)

RUL not updating:
  1. Check backend is running (look for "âœ… RUL model loaded")
  2. Refresh frontend: Cmd+Shift+R
  3. Check Network tab for /api/live-component/status requests
