# LiveWire Real-time Infrastructure Monitoring with Elastic

This directory contains the Elastic integration for real-time sensor data processing and CCI prediction.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Raspberry Pi Sensors → Elastic → LiveWire CCI Model → Real-time Alerts
```

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **Raspberry Pi** collects 4 sensor readings:
   - **Temperature** (15-45°C): Thermal stress on cables
   - **Vibration** (0.05-2.0g): Structural oscillations
   - **Strain** (50-500µε): Mechanical stress
   - **Power** (800-1500W): Electrical load

2. **Elastic** stores time-series data with indexing and search capabilities

3. **CCI Model** processes recent readings and predicts risk zones:
   - 🟢 **Green**: Normal operation
   - 🟡 **Yellow**: Warning condition  
   - 🔴 **Red**: Critical risk

4. **Alerts** sent for high-risk conditions with confidence scores

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Elastic
```bash
# Install and start Elasticsearch locally
# Then run setup
python elastic/setup_elastic.py
```

### 2. Start Sensor Simulation
```bash
# Simulates Raspberry Pi sending sensor data
python hardware/raspberry_pi_sensor.py
```

### 3. Start Real-time Prediction
```bash
# Runs CCI model on live sensor data
python elastic/realtime_predictor.py
```

- **Alerts**: http://localhost:9200/livewire-alerts/_search
- **Kibana dashboards**: http://localhost:5601

## 🎯 Cal Hacks Integration

This integration targets the **Best Use of Elastic** prize by demonstrating:

1. **Time-series ingestion** of IoT sensor data
2. **Real-time alerting** for infrastructure failures
3. **Scalable architecture** for enterprise monitoring
4. **Search and analytics** capabilities

The system provides early warning for infrastructure failures, directly supporting public safety and disaster prevention.

## 🔧 Configuration

Key parameters in `realtime_predictor.py`:
- **short_win**: 3 (recent readings for immediate response)
- **mid_win**: 12 (1-minute rolling average)
- **long_win**: 60 (5-minute trend analysis)
- **Alert thresholds**: Red > 80%, Yellow > 50%

## 📊 Expected Performance

Based on LiveWire's proven track record:
- **308 days** early warning for Camp Fire (historical validation)
- **70% accuracy** on cascade failure prediction
- **Real-time processing** with <5 second latency
- **Scalable** to thousands of sensors
